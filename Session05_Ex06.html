    <h2>5. Groups of selectors</h2>
    <p>A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual
        selectors in the list. <br> (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same
        declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. <br> White space may appear before and/or after the
        comma.</p>

    <p class="p1">CSS example: <br><br>
       In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into one. Thus, <br><br>
       h1 &#123; font-family: sans serif &#125; <br>
       h2 &#123; font-family: sans serif &#125; <br>
       h3 &#123; font-family: sans serif &#125; <br><br>
     
       is equivalent to: <br><br>

       h1, h2, h3 &#123; font-family: sans serif &#125;
    </p>
